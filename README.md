# Forum Website
A responsive forum-style web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project simulates a real forum experience with user authentication, post management, and a dynamic comment system using browser localStorage.

## Features

- Create, view, and browse posts
- Comment on posts
- Delete your comments or the comments on your posts
- Search posts by title or content
- Filter posts by category
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Pages
1. **Homepage** 
- Displays all posts
- Search and category filtering
- Posting comments

2. **Login**

- Input validation and error handling

3. **Register**

- Password confirmation & regex validation

4. **Post**

5. **Profile**

6. **Create Post**

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- localStorage for data persistence
- Font Awesome for icons

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this project
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser 
3. Or use VS Code with Live Server extension

## Current Limitations
- Authentication is frontend-only (not secure)
- No real database
- No backend API
- Sessions are simulated via localStorage

## Known Issues / Future Improvements
- [ ] Integrate a real backend (Node.js / database)
- [ ] Support user avatar uploads
- [ ] Make the view section interactive
- [ ] User rating interactive
- [ ] Improve accessibility (ARIA labels and semantic enhancements)
- [ ] Add user session handling instead of localStorage authentication
- [ ] Optimize performance and code structure
